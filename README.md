## Overview

A one-maybe-two sentence summary of what the module does/what problem it solves.
This is your 30 second elevator pitch for your module. Consider including
OS/Puppet version it works with.

## Module Description

If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology
the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section
should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use
it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration,
management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

## Setup

### What postgresql affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter,
  impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form.

### Setup Requirements

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,
etc.), mention it here.

### Beginning with postgresql

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps
for upgrading, you may wish to include an additional section here: Upgrading
(For an example, see http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/firewall).

## Usage

```puppet
node 'pgm'
{
	#.29

	class { 'sysctl': }

	class { 'postgresql':
		wal_level => 'hot_standby',
		max_wal_senders => '3',
		checkpoint_segments => '8',
		wal_keep_segments => '8',
	}

	postgresql::hba_rule { 'test':
		user => 'replicator',
		database => 'replication',
		address => '192.168.56.30/32',
	}

	postgresql::role { 'replicator':
		replication => true,
		password => 'replicatorpassword',
	}

	postgresql::schema { 'jordi':
		owner => 'replicator',
	}

}

node 'pgs'
{
	#.30

	class { 'sysctl': }

	class { 'postgresql':
		wal_level => 'hot_standby',
		max_wal_senders => '3',
		checkpoint_segments => '8',
		wal_keep_segments => '8' ,
		hot_standby => true,
		initdb => false,
	}

	class { 'postgresql::streaming_replication':
		masterhost     => '192.168.56.29',
		masterusername => 'replicator',
		masterpassword => 'replicatorpassword',
	}
}
```

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module.
This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so
people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess
with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

We are pushing to have acceptance testing in place, so any new feature should
have some test to check both presence and absence of any feature
